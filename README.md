This bot uses the turntable api by alain gilbert which can be found here:

# Installation:
1. download node.js from nodejs.org

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install ttapi
```

3. create a new account on turntable.fm, this will be your bot. login as the bot and get it's user id and auth and enter that into the script in the setup section.
    make sure that you do this in the room that you want the bot to show up in as every room has a different room id. In order to find this information out download
   the bookmark that has a link provided for it below.

4. open up the script (you can do this with notepad or notepad++, i recommend notepad++) and enter in the data it asks for in the setup section at the top of the script (read the instructions carefully)

5. open up command prompt and change directory to the directory that your script is in. in windows this is the CD command, so if the script is in a folder called chillybot on your desktop on your C drive
   it would look something like this (CD C:\Users\username\desktop\chillybot). this will vary depending on what your path is, to find out your exact path right click on the chillybot.js file and go to
   properties. Location is your exact path, do not include the chillybot.js file in your CD command, it will not find it.

6. finally in order to run the bot after you have changed directory appropriately type (node chillybot.js) without the parenthesis into command prompt and hit enter. if it does not immediately give
   you some kind of a runtime error it is working. login to your main turntable account and go to the room that you are running the bot in and see if it is there.

7. If everything has gone well, make your bot a moderator in the room so that it can effectively enforce it's commands.

  *A last note, the auto djing in this script is meant for a 5 seater room, if you have less than five seats i highly recommend you turn this feature off when you start the bot up with the /getonstage command
   If you cannot get this bot to run for some reason feel free to open an issue on github.
  
 **A recent change has made it so that your bot will not be able to log in unless you verify it's email address first**

 **Turntable.fm has changed domains to Deepcut.fm. If the bot doesn't start because of this change you'll either have to wait for an update to be published to the global node repo for ttapi 
 or go into the bot.js file in the ttapi folder in the node_modules folder and change all references from turntable.fm to deepcut.fm**
